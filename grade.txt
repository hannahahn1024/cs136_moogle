1. Functionality: 3.5/4
  * Your implementation is very slow.  I did a little digging
    and this is not really your fault-- the keySet method in
    structure5's Hashtable implementation implements sets using
    SinglyLinkedLists!  I think this is an odd choice given that
    hash tables make wonderful backing stores for Sets.  Thought
    you should know!
  * It looks like your CTF.IDF scores are going wrong somewhere.
  * Also, see note in your Table constructor about Files.walk.
  * Still!  You indexed, scored, ranked, and returned results.
    Not bad!
2. Design: 4/4
3. Documentation: 4/4
  * Nice observation about when to implement hashCodes.  This
    is a common interview question.  I was asked this question
    when I interviewed at Google!
